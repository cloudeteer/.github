## Become a contributor

You can contribute to CLOUDETEER in several ways. Here are some examples:

- Contribute to the codebase.
- Report and triage bugs.
- Write technical documentation and blog posts, for users and contributors.
- Help others by answering questions.

For more ways to contribute, check out the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

### Report bugs

Before submitting a new issue, try to make sure someone hasn't already reported the problem. Look through the `existing issues` for similar issues.

Report a bug by submitting a `bug report`. Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

<!-- Follow the issue template and add additional information that will help us replicate the problem. -->

#### Security issues

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please read our `security policy` for more details.

### Suggest enhancements

If you have an idea of how to improve something, submit an `enhancement request`.

### Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? Start by browsing issues labeled `help wanted`.

- `Help wanted` issues are problems we would like the community to help us with regardless of complexity.

When you're ready to contribute, it's time to [Create a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request).


## Creating a Pull Request

We're excited that you're considering making a contribution! This document guides you through the process of creating a `pull request`.

### Your first pull request

If this is your first time contributing to an open-source project on GitHub, make sure you read about [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

To increase the chance of having your pull request accepted, make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Title and description matches the implementation.
- The pull request closes one related issue.
- The pull request contains necessary tests that verify the intended behavior.
- If your pull request has conflicts, rebase your branch onto the main branch.

If the pull request fixes a bug:

- The pull request description must include `Closes #<issue number>` or `Fixes #<issue number>`.
- To avoid regressions, the pull request should include tests that replicate the fixed bug.

### Code review

Once you've created a pull request, the next step is to have someone review your change. A review is a learning opportunity for both the reviewer and the author of the pull request.

If you think a specific person needs to review your pull request, then you can tag them in the description or in a comment. Tag a user by typing the `@` symbol followed by their GitHub username.

We recommend that you read [How to do a code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/) to learn more about code reviews.

### Formatting guidelines

A well-written pull request minimizes the time to get your change accepted. These guidelines help you write good commit messages and descriptions for your pull requests.
